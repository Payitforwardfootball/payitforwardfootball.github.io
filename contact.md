    <p>Please nominate a low or no income, single dad who you feel deserves a free day out with his child or children. If you know what the activity they would like to do is, please also list it in the message section (max. Â£50). Please note that the message should be no more than 50 words and that as a new project, we are only able to fund a very small number of days out.
