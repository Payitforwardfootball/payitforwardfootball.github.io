title: About Dads day out.
---
<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">D</span>ads day out is a simple project designed to give low or no income single fathers, access to a small amount of money to take their children on a day out.</p>

The project has been set up in memory of John Edwin Mills. John experienced the difficulties associated with being a single, low and at times, no income father and like many single fathers in a similar situation, didn’t want to rely on government support alone. As such he worked incredibly hard for a number of years to provide meet the basic needs of his son, but during this time, he didn't have a lot of time or money to spare on luxuries like days out. Therefore, Dads day out would like to help, even in a small way, to facilitate others who find themselves in a similar place to spend a little time together. Life is short and it’s important to create some happy memories beyond simply living.

Please note that only days out with a maximum value of £50 will be considered and that due to the size of the project, only a very small number of single parent families will be accepted. We hope to be able to raise funds to support at least one parent per month and every penny raised will go directly to those in need. 

If you would like to nominate a single, low (i.e., < £10,000 per annum) or no income dad to recieve fund for a day out with his children please get in touch. If you also know the day out the family would like to receive, please add the details to the message box below. Please also note that only the activity (e.g., sports tickets, theme park entry, cinema tickets etc.) will be purchased.
