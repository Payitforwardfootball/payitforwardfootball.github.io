<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n memory of my father, John Edwin Mills, I've decided to set up a project encouraging random acts of football based kindness.</p> 

Pay it forward football (or PIFF) is, as you've probably guessed, a pay it forward initiative focused on football (i.e., American, Association, Australian Rules, Gaelic, Rugby League and Union). Simply put, we're encouring football fans to help those who love the game, but are perhaps experiencing tougher times. The act you do is up to you, but if you're struggling for ideas, why not phone a local junior team and pay an outstanding player debt (cheques are best if they don't accept online payments). Should you not wish to speak to the club, simply send a cheque with whatever you can afford and explain that you'd like the funds to pay off or go towards a players debt. Not only will your support help the child to keep playing, but it will also relieve a little pressure on a struggling family and help a grass roots club. 

Share the initiative on social media and encourage as many fans as possible to take part. Please also get in touch via social media and let us know how much you've donated and to who. We won't embarress you or post the details anywhere, but it would be nice to keep track of some of the good that is done. If you'd like us to share the details, we'll also be happy to post a notice on the Facebook page. Finally, while the initiative is targeting football fans, please don't let that stop you from paying it forward to any club or activity of your choice. If you're into martial arts, dancing, or anything else, there are plenty of children and families that could use a random act of kindness so get to it.

Remember, you don't pay for your love of the game back, you pay it forward #PIFF

ad’s day out is a simple project designed to give low or no income fathers access to a small amount of money to choose a day out with their children.


The project’s inspiration was John Edwin Mills who died in 2010. John loved days out and we would like to help those experiencing financial difficulties to spend some quality time with their children. Life is short and it’s important to create some happy memories while you can.

Please note that only days out with a maximum value of £50 will be considered and that due to the size of the project, only a very small number of dads will be supported. We hope to be able to support five families in the first instance and will be raising money to pay for the days out at Go Fund Me. Once funds have been raised, we will work with Dads House to distribute the money directly to those who will benefit the most. Should the project be a success, we will aim to help more and continue to operate on a month-by-month basis. 

If you would like to nominate a low (i.e., < £10,000 per annum) or no income dad to receive funds for a day out with his children please get in touch. If you also know the family’s desired activity, please add the details to the message box below. Please also note that only the activity (e.g., sports tickets, theme park entry, cinema tickets etc.) will be purchased and that any leftover funds will be passed to the next family.
