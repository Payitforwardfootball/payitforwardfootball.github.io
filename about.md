title: About Dads day out.
---
<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">D</span>ad’s day out is a simple project designed to give low or no income single fathers, access to a small amount of money to take their children on a day out.</p>

The project’s inspiration was John Edwin Mills, who like those we aim to support, experienced the difficulties associated with being a single, low and at times no income father. Like many single fathers in a similar situation, John didn’t want to rely on government support alone. As such he worked incredibly hard for a number of years to meet the basic needs of his son. However, this meant that he didn't have a lot of time or money to spare on luxuries such as days out. Therefore, Dad’s day out would like to help to facilitate others who find themselves in a similar situation to spend a little time together. Life is short and it’s important to create some happy memories beyond simply living.

Please note that only days out with a maximum value of £50 will be considered and that due to the size of the project, only a very small number of single parent families will be supported. We hope to be able to support 12 families in the first instance and will be raising money to pay for the days out at http://www.gofundme.com/dadsdayout. Once funds have been raised, we will work with Dads house (http://www.dadshouse.co.uk) to distribute the money directly to those who will benefit the most. 

If you would like to nominate a single, low (i.e., < £10,000 per annum) or no income dad to receive funds for a day out with his children please get in touch. If you also know the family’s desired activity, please add the details to the message box below. Please also note that only the activity (e.g., sports tickets, theme park entry, cinema tickets etc.) will be purchased and that any leftover funds will be passed to the next family.
