title: About Dads day out.

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">D</span>ad's day out is a simple project designed to give low or no income single fathers, access to a small amount of money to take their children on a day out.</p>

The project is in memory of my father, Mr John Edwin Mills, who passed away in 2010 and experienced the difficulties associated with being a single, low and at times, no income father. Like many single fathers, he didn’t want to rely on government support and worked incredibly hard for a number of years to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table.   Therefore, we would like to help, even in a small way, to facilitate others who find themselves in a similar place to spend a little time together. Life is short and it’s important to create some happy memories beyond simply living
