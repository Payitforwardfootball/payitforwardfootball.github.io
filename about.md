title: About Dads day out.
---
<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">D</span>ad’s day out is a simple project designed to give low or no income single fathers, access to a small amount of money to choose a day out with their children.</p>

The project’s inspiration was John Edwin Mills, who like those we aim to support, experienced the difficulties associated with being a single, low and at times no income father. Like many single fathers in a similar situation, John didn’t wish to rely on government support alone and as such, he worked incredibly hard for a number of years to meet the basic needs of his son. However, this meant that he didn't have a lot of time or money to spare on luxuries such as days out, which is where we hope to help. Dad’s day out aims to give dads a break and facilitate single, low or no income fathers to take a spend a little time with their children. Life is short and it’s important to create some happy memories beyond simply living.

Please note that only days out with a maximum value of £50 will be considered and that due to the size of the project, only a very small number of single parent families will be supported. We hope to be able to support five families in the first instance and will be raising money to pay for the days out at Go Fund Me. Once funds have been raised, we will work with Dads house to distribute the money directly to those who will benefit the most. Should the project be a success, we will aim to help more and continue to operate on a month-by-month basis. 

If you would like to nominate a single, low (i.e., < £10,000 per annum) or no income dad to receive funds for a day out with his children please get in touch. If you also know the family’s desired activity, please add the details to the message box below. Please also note that only the activity (e.g., sports tickets, theme park entry, cinema tickets etc.) will be purchased and that any leftover funds will be passed to the next family.
