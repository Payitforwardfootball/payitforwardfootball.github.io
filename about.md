title: About Dads day out.
---
<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">D</span>ads day out is a simple project designed to give low or no income single fathers, access to a small amount of money to take their children on a day out.</p>

The project has been set up in memory of John Edwin Mills. John experienced the difficulties associated with being a single, low and at times, no income father and like many single fathers in a similar situation, didn’t want to rely on government support alone. As such he worked incredibly hard for a number of years to provide meet the basic needs of his son, but during this time, he didn't have a lot of time or money to spare on luxuries like days out. Therefore, Dads day out would like to help, even in a small way, to facilitate others who find themselves in a similar place to spend a little time together. Life is short and it’s important to create some happy memories beyond simply living.

John Edwin Mills passed away on the 31st of March 2010 and this project is operated by his son in his memory.
